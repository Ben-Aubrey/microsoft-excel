When writing formulas, or using functions, you can have relative, absolute, or mixed cell references.

RELATIVE REFERENCES
The cells a formula, or function, reference are relative to the location of that formula or function. If I have a formula that is going to add up the three cells right above it, no matter where I copy and paste that formula to, relative to that formula's location, it will add up the three cells right above it.

RELATIVE REFERENCE EXAMPLE
=B1+C1+D1

ABSOLUTE REFERENCES
An absolute reference is a reference that always stays constant. You create an absolute reference by placing the '$' symbol in front of *both* the row and column reference. No matter where you copy and paste a formula to, the absolute reference will always stay the same.

ABSOLUTE REFERENCE EXAMPLE
=B1*$F$9
(The $F$9 reference is the absolute reference. The $F$9 reference will always stay the same no matter where the formula gets copy/pasted)

MIXED REFERENCE
A mixed reference is a reference where only the column or the row is held absolute for a cell. 

MIXED REFERENCE EXAMPLE
=B1*F$9
(In this example, only the row [row 9] in the F$9 reference is being held absolute, the column [column F] can shift as the formula is copy/pasted around)
