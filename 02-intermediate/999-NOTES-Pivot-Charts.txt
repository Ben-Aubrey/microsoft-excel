PIVOT CHARTS allow you to quickly chart your data in different ways.

To create a Pivot Chart:
place your active cell within your table of data then go to:
INSERT / PIVOT CHARTS

You can download TEMPLATES from Microsoft's website to get more ideas for how to chart data.

These templates are pre-built workbooks that will allow you to do a variety of things.

It's a good idea to search TEMPLATES to see if someone has already created a workbook for what you want to do!
